## What I have learned so far
So far what i have learned in github is how to make repositorys in git, also push the things we made in text editor to the git repository. We learned how to make branches on github to organize things we have worked on. We also learned how to push, and pull to those branches we have made. I also learned how to merge branches to one another in git.\
